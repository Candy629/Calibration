Extrinsic Calibration between Camera and Laser Range Scanner

1. This contains:
	
 - Implementation of the method proposed in:

   F. Vasconcelos, J.P. Barreto, and U. Nunes, "A Minimal Solution for the
   Extrinsic Calibration of a Camera and a Laser-Rangefinder", IEEE TPAMI,
   2012

 - Implementation of a robust version of Zhang & Pless method, proposed in:
   
   Qilong Zhang; Pless, R.; , "Extrinsic calibration of a camera and laser
   range finder (improves camera calibration)," IROS, 2004

 - Demonstration script: ./demo.m  


2. Required data:

 - Set of calibration plane poses in the camera reference frame, this can 
   be obtained, for example, using 
     Bouguet toolbox (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/)
     EasyCamCalib (http://arthronav.isr.uc.pt/easycamcalib/)

 - A set of 2D point laser measurements of the calibration plane, for 
   each pose.
   NOTE: usualy, laser scanners output depth measurements, hence it
   is required to compute the cartesian 2D coordinates of each point.


3. Instructions:

 - Define this as the current working directory of MATLAB.
 - Open and run ./demo.m for understanding input & output data.
